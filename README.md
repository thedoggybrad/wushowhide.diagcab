# Windows Show or Hide Updates Troubleshooter
The official "Windows Show or Hide Updates Troubleshooter" is a tool Microsoft created to hide or show Windows Updates. This repository is an archive of the troubleshooting file.

<br>
It can hide or show a specific update forever or unless you reverse your decision.

Why this repository exists in the first place?
<br>
A: Microsoft had shutted down the official link of the file. Luckily it is archived on WayBack Machine.
Now, I had decided to create a repository for it due to its low popularity.
