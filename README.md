# Windows Show or Hide Updates Troubleshooter
The "Windows Show or Hide Updates Troubleshooter" is a tool Microsoft Corporation had created to hide or show Windows Updates. This repository is an archive of the troubleshooting file.
<br>
<br>
It can hide or show a specific update forever or unless you reverse your decision.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Why this repository exists in the first place?
<br>
A: Microsoft had shutted down the official link of the file. Luckily, it is archived on the WayBack Machine.
Now, I had decided to create a repository for it due to its low popularity.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Q: In what situation I can use this tool?
<br>
A: You can use this tool to hide buggy or problematic Windows Updates, so that the updates will never show or will install again (unless you reverse the hiding).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Is the file really safe? I am worried about the safety of my computer.
<br>
A: It is 100% safe because the file is created by Microsoft themselves, it is not modified in anyway. Not convinced? You may check its safety on VirusTotal that is linked right here: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8723b97b8e4ede3b5b7fd0ba129edfbc113a4db329609f0eaffe24e6a37e019e/summary/
